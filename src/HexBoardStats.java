/****************************************************************************
 *  Command: HexBoardStats N0 N1 T
 *
 *  This program takes the board sizes N0,N1 and game count T as a command-line
 *  arguments. Then, the program runs T games for each board size N where
 *  N0 <= N <= N1 and where each play randomly chooses an unset tile to set in
 *  order to estimate the probability that player 1 will win.
