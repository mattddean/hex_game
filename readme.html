General
========

For each of your team's implementations, explain the following (where appropriate and applicable):

- details on calling conventions, input and output data formats, limitations, bugs, and special features.
- negative aspects of your program (limitations, known bugs)
- positive aspects (extensions, special features)
- describe your choice of modularization (abstractions), data structures, and algorithms
- explain anything you did that is likely to be different from what other students may have done
- justify any design decisions for which the rationale isn't immediately clear

Feel free to modify the structure of this `readme.html` file to fit the current assignment and to fit how you wish to present your findings.

Assignment Details
===================


Describe how you implemented HexBoard.java.
How did you check whether the game was won by a player?

Quick-Find Union-Find
---------------------

Using `HexBoard` with `QuickFindUF`, give a formula (using tilde notation) for the running time (in seconds) of `HexBoardStats.java` as a function of both $N$ and $T$.

Model the running time as a power law and be sure to give both the coefficient and exponent of the leading term.
Your coefficients should be based on empirical data and rounded to two significant digits, for example:

$$\sim 5.3*10^{-8} * N^{5.0} T^{1.5} $$

(keep $T$ constant)

$N$ | time (seconds)
----|---------------
... |               
... |               
... |               
... |               
... |               


(keep $N$ constant)

$T$ | time (seconds)
----|---------------
... |               
... |               
... |               
... |               
... |               

running time as a function of $N$ and $T$:  $\sim NT$ <!-- replace NT with your answer -->



Weighted Quick-Union Union-Find
-------------------------------

Repeat the steps of the previous section for `WeightedQuickUnionUF`.

(keep $T$ constant)

$N$ | time (seconds)
----|---------------
... |               
... |               
... |               
... |               
... |               


(keep $N$ constant)

$T$ | time (seconds)
----|---------------
... |               
... |               
... |               
... |               
... |               

running time as a function of $N$ and $T$:  $\sim NT$ <!-- replace NT with your answer -->



Hex Board Statistics
--------------------

Run `HexBoardStats` with `N0 = 2`, `N1 = 15`, and `T = 100000`.

What patterns do you see emerge from probability estimates?
